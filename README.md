**Cybersecurity Internship Task 6** - Create and evaluate password strength using online tools.

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Test different password combinations to understand what makes passwords strong and evaluate them using password strength checker tools.

---

## 🛠️ **Tools Used**

- **passwordmeter.com** - Password strength analyzer
- **howsecureismypassword.net** - Crack time calculator
- **Various online checkers** - Multiple tool comparison

---

## 📋 **Password Testing Results**

| Password Type | Example Format | Strength Score | Time to Crack | Rating |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Weak** | `password123` | 25/100 | 0.29 milliseconds | ❌ Very Weak |
| **Medium** | `Password123!` | 60/100 | 3 days | ⚠️ Fair |
| **Strong** | `MyP@ssw0rd2024!` | 85/100 | 3 thousand years | ✅ Strong |
| **Very Strong** | `Tr0ub4dor&3@Secure!` | 95/100 | 15 million years | ✅ Very Strong |

## 📊 **Key Findings**

### **Password Strength Factors**
- **Length**: 12+ characters significantly improve security
- **Complexity**: Mix of upper/lower case, numbers, symbols
- **Unpredictability**: Avoid common words and patterns
- **Uniqueness**: No repeated characters or sequences

### **Common Weaknesses Found**
- Dictionary words easily cracked
- Simple number/symbol additions don't help much
- Short passwords (<8 chars) are always weak
- Personal information makes passwords vulnerable

---

## 🔍 **Security Analysis**

### **Attack Resistance**
- **Brute Force**: Strong passwords resist automated attempts
- **Dictionary Attack**: Complex passwords avoid common word lists
- **Social Engineering**: Unpredictable passwords harder to guess

### **Best Practices Learned**
1. **Use 12+ characters minimum**
2. **Mix all character types** (upper, lower, numbers, symbols)
3. **Avoid personal information** (names, dates, places)
4. **Use unique passwords** for different accounts
5. **Consider passphrases** for better memorability

---

## 🛡️ **Recommendations**

### **Strong Password Formula**
```
[Random Word] + [Numbers] + [Symbols] + [Mixed Case]
Example: "Coffee#2024$Secure!"
```

### **Additional Security**
- **Password Manager**: Store complex passwords safely
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add extra security layer
- **Regular Updates**: Change passwords periodically

---

## 🎓 **Learning Outcomes**

- ✅ **Password Security**: Understanding strength factors
- ✅ **Attack Methods**: Knowledge of brute force and dictionary attacks
- ✅ **Tool Usage**: Testing with multiple strength checkers
- ✅ **Best Practices**: Creating secure password policies
- ✅ **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating password vulnerabilities

---

## ⚖️ **Ethical Notice**

This analysis was conducted for **educational purposes only**. Never use weak passwords in real systems or attempt to crack others' passwords without authorization.
